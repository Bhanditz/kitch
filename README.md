# itch canary

This is repository's purpose is to serve the 'canary' (unstable) release
of the itch app.

If you haven't been explicitly told by someone to use this, then you probably
shouldn't use this :)

In particular, **the canary channel is broken right now** - it won't let you
install or run games, a complete rewrite is happening, so, you might want to
hold off, even if you do love to live on the bleeding edge.
